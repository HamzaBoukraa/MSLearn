# Introduction

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Created in the early 1990s, it enjoys a wide range of uses from automating repetitive tasks and writing Web applications to building machine-learning models and implementing neural networks. Researchers, mathematicians, and data scientists in particular find Python alluring due to its rich and easy-to-understand syntax and the wide range of open-source packages available. Packages are commonly used, shared code libraries which are freely available for anyone to use. Just a few of the popular packages include:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), which adds sophisticated scientific and numerical computing capabilities to Python with its support for large, multidimensional arrays and matrices and functions for operating on them
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), a 2D plotting library that allows you to create visually rich graphs, charts, and plots from your data
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which provides a rich interface for manipulating complex datasets in memory and is widely used to shape data for use in training machine-learning models
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), which vastly simplifies the task of building machine-learning models using a variety of learning algorithms, both [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) and [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/), which lets you build sophisticated neural networks — including deep [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), which have revolutionized the field of computer vision — with just a few lines of code

Developers tend to rely heavily on open-source packages to save time and build more sophisticated applications with less code. For new programmers, these packages offer a fast start into the worlds of numerical analysis, predictive analytics, and other disciplines.

Applications coded with Python can run on almost all computer systems including those running Windows, macOS, and popular distributions of Linux. Furthermore, the ecosystem contains a rich set of development tools for writing, debugging, and publishing Python applications, as well as an active user community that is eager to help new programmers learn the [Pythonic way](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/).

## Your job, should you choose to accept it

Imagine that you've been tasked with collecting information about U.S. airports and performing some basic analysis on the data. For example, you need to know how many airports are present in each state and which city or state has the most airports. Perhaps you are experienced with programming languages such as Java and C++, but have no experience with Python. Or perhaps you aren't a programmer at all. Nonetheless, a little time invested in learning Python can make short work of the task at hand.

In a series of hands-on lessons, you will learn the basics of Python as you build an app that operates on airport data downloaded from a U.S. Government Web site. Along the way, you will learn about one of the most useful tools available to Python programmers: [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), which provide an interactive platform for writing and testing Python code.   

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn:

- How to create a Jupyter notebook in Azure
- How to build Python applications in Jupyter notebooks
- How to deal with variables and data types in Python
- How to perform input and output in Python
- How to read text files in Python
- How to perform looping in Python
- How to work with strings in Python, and how to parse text input
- How to use conditional statements to perform branching in Python
- How to use functions in Python and how (and when) to write your own functions
- How to perform practical problem solving with Python and Jupyter notebooks

There is much to do, so let's get started.
