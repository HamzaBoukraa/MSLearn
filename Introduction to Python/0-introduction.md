# Introduction

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum, Python is used for many kinds of computing activities such as web applications, data science, machine learning, and even system administration tasks. Contributing to Pythonâ€™s popularity is it's easy to understand syntax, large number built-in functions (known as an API) and a large number of scientific and mathematics packages. In addition to the qualities of the language, there is a huge community of Python developers which can help new Python developers to learn Python and the Pythonic way of doing things. The Pythonic way refers to following coding practices which are generally accepted by the community to make development easier for everyone.

For many people, Python is the very first language they learn. Many of those people are not traditional software developers; rather, they are practitioners in other fields such as scientific research and Python is just another tool to help them do their primary more effectively. For others, Python is a great additional programming tool to add to their toolbox.

Applications coded with Python can run on almost all computer systems including Microsoft Windows, Apple's MacOS, Linux (all distributions) and on local and cloud-based systems. Furthermore, there is a rich set of development tools to help code, debug and publish Python applications. Popular tools include Microsoft's Visual Studio Code and Azure's hosted Jupyter Notebooks.

So whether this is your first language or just your next language, and whether you are a software developer or a professional in another field, this tutorial will walk you through the basics of learning the Python language through a scenario-based approach. The goal is to learn not only the academic side of Python but also begin to apply it to solve real-world problems. Furthermore, while this tutorial is not teaching topics like data science or machine learning, many of the examples are coding tasks which would be commonly performed in such computing fields.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn:

- How to create a Jupyter notebook in Azure
- The basics of Python, including variables, functions, and conditionals 
- How to perform practical problem solving with Python and Jupyter notebooks
