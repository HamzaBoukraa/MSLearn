# Use Matplotlib to investigate flight delays

Now that you know the basics of Matplotlib, let's use what you learned to visualize flight data and better understand why delays occur and what the main drivers are. Such information might be useful the next time you book a flight because if you knew, for example, that a flight that leaves in the late afternoon is twice as likely to be delayed as one that leaves in the morning, or that connections in and out of JFK are 50% more likely to be delayed than connections through ATL, you might alter your travel plans to increase the chance of an on-time arrival.

## Use scatter plots to explore relationships

A scatter plot is a great way to visualize relationships between variables in a dataset and test hypotheses such as "morning flights are less likely to incur long delays than afternoon flights". Let's use Matplotlib to generate a few scatter plots from the "all_flights" dataset.

1. Begin by returning to [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) and creating a new notebook named "Matplotlib" in the "Data Handling in Python" project that you created earlier. Select Python 3.6 as the language.

1. Run the following statement in the notebook's first cell to import a large CSV file from Azure blob storage:

	```bash
	!curl https://topcs.blob.core.windows.net/public/all_flights.csv -o flights.csv
	```

1. Now run the following code in the next cell to load **flights.csv** into a Pandas DataFrame and count the rows and columns in the dataset:

	```python
	impport pandas as pd

	df = pd.read_csv('flights.csv')
	df.shape
	```

1. Use the following statements to import Matplotlib and configure the notebook to show Matpoltlib output:

	```python
	%matplotlib inline
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	```

1. It is reasonable to expect that there might be a correlation between departure delays and arrival delays since a plane that leaves late will also arrive late unless the crew can make up time in the air. Test this supposition by creating a scatter plot of departure-delay and arrival-delay values:

	```python
	df.plot(kind='scatter', x='DEP_DELAY', y='ARR_DELAY')
	```

	Confirm that this produces the following output:

	![Plotting departure delays and arrival delays](media/ScatterPlotArrivalDepartureDelay.png) 

	Not surprisingly, the correlation between departure delays and arrival delays is strong.

1. Use another scatter plot to check for a correlation between arrival delays and flight numbers:

	```python
	df.plot(kind='scatter', x='OP_CARRIER_FL_NUM', y='ARR_DELAY')
	```

	This time, there appears to be little correlation between the two independent variables:

	![Plotting flight numbers and arrival delays](media/ScatterPlotFlightNumDelay.png)

1. It might be more interesting to check for a correlation between scheduled departure times and flight delays. Due to the hub-and-spoke system used by most airlines, delays early in the day can lead to delays later in the day as well. Use the following code to test this hypothesis:

	```python
	df.plot(kind='scatter', x='CRS_DEP_TIME', y='ARR_DELAY')
	```

What does the output tell you about the theory that a traveler is more likely to encounter delays by flying in mid-afternoon than early morning?

## Use bar charts to visualize delays at individual airports

Now let's use bar charts to visualize delays at individual airports and determine at which airports travelers are most likely to encounter delays. 

1. Display a bar chart showing the mean departure delay by originating airport:

	```python
	df.groupby('ORIGIN')['DEP_DELAY'].mean().plot(kind='bar')
	```

	![Plotting departure delays by airport](media/barchartdelaysAllairports.png)  

1. This chart is hard to read, so let's extract only the rows for the busiest airports and show the mean departure delay for each: 

	```python
	flights_busy_airports = df.loc[df['ORIGIN'].isin(['ATL','LAX','ORD','DFW','JFK'])]
	flights_busy_airports.groupby('ORIGIN')['DEP_DELAY'].mean().plot(kind='bar')
	```

	Is there one airport that stands out from the rest in terms of departure delays?

1. A couple of lessons ago, you used a fairly complex line of code to determine which ten airports suffer the longest average departure delays. Build on what you did there to show the data in a bar chart:

	```python
	ax = df.groupby('ORIGIN')['DEP_DELAY'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10).plot(kind='bar', width=0.8)
	ax.set_ylabel('Average delay in minutes')
	```

	The results look like this, once more confirming that Southwest Oregon Regional Airport is probably not a favorite among frequent flyers:

	![Airports with the longest average departure delays](media/worst-airports-plot.png) 

	You learned something new here. When you plot with Matplotlib, you can use `xlabel()` and `ylabel()` to add labels to the X and Y axis. To do the same when plotting with a DataFrame, you call `set_xlabel()` and `set_ylabel()` on the `AxesSubplot` object returned by the DataFrame's `plot()` method.


1. Let's go a step further and show the spread of departure delays (good and bad), but limit the number of airports shown so the chart isn't too cluttered. Start by determining how many different airports are represented in the dataset:

	```python
	len(df.groupby('ORIGIN'))
	```

1. Earlier, you learned how to use a lambda expression to select every other row in a DataFrame. Here is that code again:

	```python
	df.iloc[lambda x: x.index % 2 == 0]
	```

	Use the same technique to select every 30th row in a DataFrame grouped by origin and sorted by average departure delay and produce a bar chart from the results. Can you envision what the chart might look like before running the code?





1. Another interesting way of looking at the data is to plot mean arrival delays by destination airport. Do flights into ORD, for example, incur longer delays, on average, than flights into DFW? Use the following code to find out: 

	```python
	flights_busy_airports.groupby('DEST')['ARR_DELAY'].mean().plot(kind='bar')
	```

Does the resulting plot provide any meaningful insights to the data? 

## Use a histogram to explore further

Let's say the goal is to learn more about the nature of the delays â€” specifically, how the number of short delays compares to the number of long delays. It's reasonable to expect that there are more 10-minute delays than 1-hour delays. But what does the distribution look like? 

1. Create a histogram of arrival delays to show how many flights were 0 to 10 minutes late, 10 to 20 minutes late, and so on:

	```python
	flight_df[['ARR_DELAY']].plot(kind='hist', bins=[0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110,120], rwidth=0.8)
	```

1. Confirm that the output looks like this:

	![Flight delay histogram](media/flightDelayhistogram.png)

	Not surprisingly, short delays are more common than long delays, and thankfully, the number of delays drops off rapidly as the length of the delay increases:
