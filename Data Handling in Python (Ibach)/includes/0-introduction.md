# Introduction

Imagine that you work in the IT department for a major airline. The airline is concerned about the impact that flight delays are having on cost overruns and has asked you to have a look at the data to get a better handle on the problem. The data comes from a variety of data sources. It has been aggregated and provided to you in the form of comma-separated (CSV) files. As is often the case, the data is rather raw and will require some cleaning up to ensure accurate analysis. 

To meet the airline's needs, you will need to:

- Read data from CSV files and store it in data structures
- Extract subsets of the data to focus on key information
- Perform aggregations such as calculating the mean across multiple values
- Create visualizations to illustrate your conclusions

Python has a number of features to make analyzing and manipulating data easy. Python itself has data structures that you can use to store and manipulate data. Popular libraries such as [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) expand Python's power and make it the perfect tool for the job. With this in mind, you set out to brush up on your Python and learn about some of the language features such as *comprehensions* and *lambdas* that you didn't learn in school. And you resolve to deliver your conclusions on time and under budget by leveraging libraries wherever possible.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will upload data and analyze it using a variety of Python functions and libraries. First, you will learn basic data structures in Python. Then, you will learn how to iterate across those structures. Next, you will learn how to use the NumPy and pandas libraries to upload data files and operate on data. Finally you will use the Matplotlib library to visualize data. Along the way, you will learn:

- How to use Python sequence and mapping types to store and slice data
- How to use comprehensions and lambdas to iterate and act on data
- How to use NumPy to read and store data from csv files, calculate aggregates, and operate on data
- How to use pandas to read and store data from csv files, calculate aggregates, and operate on data
- How to use Matplotlib to visualize data
