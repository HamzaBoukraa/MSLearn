# Introduction

Imagine that you work for a major airline. The airline is concerned that flight delays are causing cost overruns. You have been asked to analyze historical flight data to better define the problem. The data comes from a variety of databases and files. All the data has been merged and provided to you in comma-separated (.csv) files. Some of the airports who provided data are still using legacy systems so it is possible the data will need clean up to ensure accurate reporting. 

To meet the airline needs you will need to:
- Read and store structured data
- Extract subsets of data to focus on key information
- Combine data from multiple files into single data structures
- Perform aggregations such as calculating the mean across multiple values
- Create visualizations of flight data

Fortunately, Python has a number of features and libraries for data handling. Python itself has data structures you can use to store and manipulate data. The NumPy and pandas libraries contain additional features enabling you to manipulate data, filter data, and calculate aggregations. the Matplotlib library is used for creating visualizations such as bar graphs and histograms. 

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will upload data and analyze it using a variety of Python functions and libraries. First, you will learn basic data structures in Python. Then, you will learn how to iterate across those structures. Next, you will learn how to use the NumPy and pandas libraries to upload data files and operate on data. Finally you will use the Matplotlib library to visualize data. Along the way, you will learn:

- How to use Python sequence and mapping types to store and slice data
- How to use comprehensions and lambdas to iterate and act on data
- How to use NumPy to read and store data from csv files, calculate aggregates, and operate on data
- How to use pandas to read and store data from csv files, calculate aggregates, and operate on data
- How to use Matplotlib to visualize data
