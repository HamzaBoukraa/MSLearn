# Introduction

Imagine that you work in the IT department for a major airline. The airline is concerned about the impact that flight delays are having on cost overruns and has asked you to have a look at the data to get a better handle on the problem. The data comes from a variety of data sources. It has been aggregated and provided to you in the form of comma-separated (CSV) files. As is often the case, the data is rather raw and will require some cleaning up to ensure accurate analysis. 

To meet the airline needs you will need to:

- Read and store structured data
- Extract subsets of the data to focus on key information
- Aggregate data from multiple CSV files into single data structures
- Perform aggregations such as calculating the mean across multiple values
- Create visualizations to gain further insights into flight data

Fortunately, Python has a number of features and libraries to make analyzing and manipulating data easy. Python itself has data structures you can use to store and manipulate data. Popular libraries such as [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) extpand Python's power and make it a first-rate tool for handling data. 

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will upload data and analyze it using a variety of Python functions and libraries. First, you will learn basic data structures in Python. Then, you will learn how to iterate across those structures. Next, you will learn how to use the NumPy and pandas libraries to upload data files and operate on data. Finally you will use the Matplotlib library to visualize data. Along the way, you will learn:

- How to use Python sequence and mapping types to store and slice data
- How to use comprehensions and lambdas to iterate and act on data
- How to use NumPy to read and store data from csv files, calculate aggregates, and operate on data
- How to use pandas to read and store data from csv files, calculate aggregates, and operate on data
- How to use Matplotlib to visualize data
