# Introduction

Imagine that you work in the Planning & Logistics department for a major airline. Your employer is concerned about the impact that flight delays are having on cost overruns and has asked you to look at the data to get a better handle on the problem. The data comes from a variety of data sources. It has been aggregated and provided to you in the form of comma-separated-value (CSV) files. As is often the case, the data is rather raw and will require some cleaning before you do anything with it. 

Python has a number of features for manipulating data. Popular libraries such as [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) expand Python's power and make it the perfect tool for the job. It's time to brush up on your Python skills and familiarize yourself with newer language features such as [lambda functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp) and [comprehensions](https://medium.com/better-programming/list-comprehension-in-python-8895a785550b) that simplify data handling and manipulation. And it's time to learn how Pandas and other libraries make the job easier.

In this module, you will acquire the basic skills needed to tackle projects such as this one, even if you're new to Python. You will produce charts and graphs such as these to illustrate key insights gleaned from the data. You will do your work in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which provide an interactive and easy-to-use vehicle for experimenting with Python code. And your platform for Jupyter will be [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com), which provide Jupyter-as-a-Service for free.

## Learning objectives

Here's a preview of the skills you will acquire in this module:

- How to use sequences and other data structures to store data
- How to use comprehensions and lambda functions to simplify your code
- How to use NumPy to manipulate data and subject it to basic statistical analysis
- How to use Pandas to import data, clean data, and query data
- How to use Matplotlib to visualize data

The beauty of Python is that you can accomplish a lot with a little code. It's just a matter of knowing *what* code to write.
