# Comprehensions and lambdas

In the previous lesson, you learned about sequences and dictionaries in Python. After these come [comprehensions](https://medium.com/better-programming/list-comprehension-in-python-8895a785550b) and [lambda functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp), which make sequences and dictionaries — especially sequences — easier to work with. In this lesson, you will learn how to use comprehensions and lambda functions (also known as *anonymous functions*) to make code that deals with collections of data simpler and more concise.

## Comprehensions

Comprehensions in Python provide a concise syntax for creating sequences, especially lists. Python 2 introduced list comprehensions and Python 3 added dictionary and set comprehensions. Let's wrap our heads around comprehensions by taking a look at list comprehensions.

## Lambda functions

Comprehensions can be made simpler with lambda functions, which are small functions that have no name.

Now you know the basics of lists, tuples, strings, comprehensions, and lambda expressions in Python. In the next lesson, you'll put this knowledge to work using a dataset stored in a CSV file.
