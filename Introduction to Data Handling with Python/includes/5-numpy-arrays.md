# Using numpy arrays


## Airline Data Exercise: Creating a Numpy Array of Ontime Flight Data

The airline data exercise results in a Jupyter notebook which will load and analyze airport, state and ontime flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. In this fifth exercise within the module, the ontime flight data will be combined with the airport and state data to create a numpy array.

1. Open the Jupyter notebook named 'Airline Data Exercise' in Azure Notebooks. You may want to make a duplicate copy of this notebook before attempting this exercise.
