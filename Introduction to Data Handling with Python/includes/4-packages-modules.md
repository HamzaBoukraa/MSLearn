# Using packages and modules


## Airline Data Exercise: Dividing an Notebook into Modules and using a Package

The airline data exercise results in a Jupyter notebook which will load and analyze airport, state and ontime flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. In this fourth exercise within the module, the airport and state dictionary loading code will be moved to a new file and the numpy package will be used.

1. Open the Jupyter notebook named 'Airline Data Exercise' in Azure Notebooks. You may want to make a duplicate copy of this notebook before attempting this exercise.
