  title: Make and track changes
  description: Check your understanding of Git change tracking.

      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: "Many older VCSs did this; it can save a lot of space, but it's slow and doesn't work well with binary files."
    - content: "When you stage a file, Git computes its hash and compares it to the hash of the file previously at that location."

      correctExplanation: "Git stores whole files and identifies them by their SHA-1 hashes."
