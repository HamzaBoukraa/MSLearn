# Introduction

You probably use office automation tools such as [Microsoft Word](https://products.office.com/en-us/word), [Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel), and PowerPoint frequently to compose, experiment with, and collaborate on your ideas.  Fluency in use of these products is a powerful skill.  Think how that power multiples, though, when we combine those familiar techniques of entry and composition with computer programs which prepare or update documents _automatically_.  That's the promise and achievement of this module.

What does it mean to manage or update a document automatically?  Think of it this way:  every time you find yourself stuck on a tedious chore--having to copy-and-paste the same kind of content you did last week, for instance--you have the opportunity to automate that operation so it happens quicker, more reliably, and without your supervision.  You liberate your time and attention, and the computer takes over more of the work at which computers are tops.

This module gives specific examples of work you might want to automate, and how to do so.


## Your mission, should you choose to accept it [TODO:  is this title invariant?]

[Imagine that you've been tasked with collecting information about U.S. airports and answering some basic questions using the data. For example, you need to know how many airports are present in each state and which city or state has the most airports. Perhaps you are experienced with programming languages such as Java and C++, but have no experience with Python. Or perhaps you aren't a programmer at all. Nonetheless, a little time invested in learning Python can make short work of the task at hand.]

[In a series of hands-on lessons, you will learn the basics of Python by building a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) that loads airport data downloaded from a U.S. Government Web site and manipulates the data. Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive platform for writing and testing Python code, and they're easily built in [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/), which offer Jupyter as a service for free.]

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn:

- How to set up a working Python development environment
- How to read from and write to a Microsoft Word document using **python-docx**
- How to read from and write to a Microsoft Excel document using **PyXLL**
- How to create an Excel UDF with Python
- How to manage PDF documents with **PyPDF4**

There is much to do, so let's get started.  [TODO:  invariant?]
