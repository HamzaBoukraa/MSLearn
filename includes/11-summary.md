# Summary

In this module, you learned the basics of using Git:  installing Git;
creating, cloning, and exploring repositories; tracking changes; recovering
from mistakes; collaborating with other developers; creating, merging, and
rebasing branches; resolving merge conflicts, and some of the uses of hooks
and tags.  You also learned the basics of Git's terminology, how to read Git's
documentation from the command line, and a few other useful commands.

At this point you know enough about Git to perform everyday tasks, get
yourself out of trouble if things get confusing, and understand any
documentation you run across.

Have fun!
