# Branching and merging

At this point it's become clear that you need a way for people to work more
independently.  Branches make this easy, and unlike many other
version control systems, making a branch in `git` is nearly instantaneous.

* discuss feature branches.
* git branch
* git checkout -b
* merge (fast-forward)
* `git stash`
* merge (non-fast-forward)
* we've already seen rebase in the form of `git pull --rebase`.  Time to show
  `git rebase` and `git rebase -i` as alternatives to merge.
* `git merge --abort`
