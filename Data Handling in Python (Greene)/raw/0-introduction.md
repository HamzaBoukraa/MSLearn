# Introduction

This is the second module in the learning Python series. In the first module of this series the essentials of the Python language were explored. The essentials included using Jupyter notebooks, Python's type system, Python expressions, organizing code with functions, reading and writing files and downloading files over HTTP. This module will build on the foundation laid in the first module to further explore sequence and mapping types, using lambda functions and comprehensions, structuring data and code together with classes, Python packages & modules, and using Numpy. Also, a quick introduction MatPlotLib for generating visualizations is included as well.

The Python concepts will be further explored through a series of scenario-based lab exercises. The scenario will use basic statistics to explore flight delays as US airports. In addition to the data processing using code Python features, the generating of statistics and visualizations will be accomplished with NumPy and MatplotLib, respectively. To code and run the scenario, Jupyter notebooks will be used. The airline flight and airport data will be provided by the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/).

 This module does assume basic Python knowledge from the first module or through prior Python programming experience.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn:

- Explore helpful types and syntax structures
- How Python code is organized with packages and modules
- Using Numpy for high performance data arrays and calculations
