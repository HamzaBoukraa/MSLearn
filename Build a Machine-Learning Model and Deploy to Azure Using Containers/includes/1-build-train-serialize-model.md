# Build, train, and serialize a machine-learning model

The first order of business is to create a machine-learning model that can examine a string of text and assign it a score from 0.0 to 1.0 quantifying the sentiment expressed therein. Ten years ago, that would have been a Herculean task. Today, it's rather easy with [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).

Scikit-learn is probably the most popular library on the planet for building machine-learning models. It's free, it's open-source, and it's preloaded into [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com), which is a cloud-based platform for building and running [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).  Jupyter is an environment based on [IPython](https://ipython.org/) that facilitates interactive programming and data analysis using a variety of programming languages, including Python. Jupyter notebooks enjoy widespread use in research and academia for mathematical modeling, machine learning, and statistical analysis. Azure Notebooks provide Jupyter as a service for free. It's a convenient way to build notebooks and share them with others without having to install and manage a Jupyter server. And it's completely Web-based, making it an ideal solution for collaborating online.

In this lesson, you will create an Azure notebook and use Scikit-learn to build a sentiment-analysis model. Then you will serialize the model and download a pair of files that allow the model to be loaded by other applications.

## Create an Azure notebook





## Build and train the model





## Serialize the model

The final task is to serialize model and download it from your Azure notebook. Serializing the model requires just one line of code: a call to `pickle.save()` in Python's [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module.
