# Build, train, and serialize a machine-learning model

The first order of business is to create a machine-learning model that can examine a string of text and assign it a score from 0.0 to 1.0 quantifying the sentiment expressed therein. Ten years ago, that would have been a Herculean task. Today, it's rather easy with [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).

Scikit-learn is probably the most popular library on the planet for building machine-learning models. It's free, it's open-source, and it's preloaded into [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com), which is a cloud-based platform for building and running [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).  Jupyter is an environment based on [IPython](https://ipython.org/) that facilitates interactive programming and data analysis using a variety of programming languages, including Python. Jupyter notebooks enjoy widespread use in research and academia for mathematical modeling, machine learning, and statistical analysis. Azure Notebooks provide Jupyter as a service for free. It's a convenient way to build notebooks and share them with others without having to install and manage a Jupyter server. And it's completely Web-based, making it an ideal solution for collaborating online.

In this lesson, you will create an Azure notebook and use Scikit-learn to build a sentiment-analysis model. Then you will serialize the model and download a pair of files that allow the model to be loaded by other applications.

## Create an Azure notebook

Jupyter notebooks are composed of *cells*. Each cell is assigned one of four types:

- **Markdown** for entering text in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format
- **Code** for entering code that runs interactively
- **Raw NBConvert** for entering data inline
- **Heading** for section headers   

Code entered into code cells is executed by a *kernel*. The popular IPython kernel supports code written in Python, but [dozens of other kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) are available supporting other languages. Azure notebooks (Jupyter notebooks created in Azure) support Python, R, and F#. They also support numerous packages and libraries that are commonly used in Python.

Azure notebooks are created through the portal at https://notebooks.azure.com and require nothing more than a browser and a [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account). Notebooks are contained in projects, whose primary purpose is to group related notebooks. In this exercise, you will create a new project and then create a notebook inside it.

1. Navigate to https://notebooks.azure.com in your browser and sign in using your Microsoft account. Click **My Projects** in the menu at the top of the page. Then click the **+ New Project** button at the top of the "My Projects" page.

1. Create a new project named "Machine Learning." Check the "Public" box if you'd like to share notebooks with other people later on. You can also go into project settings once a project is created and change its visibility to public or private.

1. Click **+ New** and select **Notebook** from the menu to add a notebook to the project.

1. Name the notebook "Sentiment Analysis.ipynb," and select **Python 3.6** as the language. This will create a notebook with a Python 3.6 kernel for executing Python code. One of the strengths of Azure notebooks is that you can use different languages by choosing different kernels.

	If you're curious, the **.ipynb** file-name extension stands for "IPython notebook." Jupyter notebooks were originally known as IPython (Interactive Python) notebooks, and they only supported Python as a programming language. The name Jupyter is a combination of Julia, Python, and R â€” the core programming languages that Jupyter supports.

1. Click the notebook to open it for editing.

You can create additional projects and notebooks as you work with Azure Notebooks. You can create notebooks from scratch, or you can upload existing notebooks. And once a notebook is created or uploaded, you can take advantage of Azure compute resources to run the notebook and leverage popular Python libraries such as [Keras](https://keras.io/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).





## Build and train the model





## Serialize the model

The final task is to serialize model and download it from your Azure notebook. Serializing the model requires just one line of code: a call to `pickle.save()` in Python's [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module.
