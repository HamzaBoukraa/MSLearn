# Summary

Put all these together and you have the start of what you need to know about Bash.
This is only the beginning. Linux sysadmins spend their entire careers sharpening their Bash skills. 
In this module, you learned the basics of using Bash. Among the skills you learned were:

- How to set up an Ubuntu Linux VM with the Azure Cloud Shell
- How to securely logging into your VM with SSH
- Basic Bash concepts and syntax
- Bash wildcards
- Bash Command Basics
- Bash I/O operators
- How to update an Ubuntu system
- How to terminate bad processes
- How to find and get rid of unwanted users
- How to use Bash with the Azure Cloud Shell

When you are ready to take the next step in learning Bash, here are three books you might find valuable:

- [The Bash Guide](https://guide.bash.academy/)
- [Learn Shell](https://www.learnshell.org/)
- [Learning the Shell](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php)

This is only the merest taste of Bash's power. Extensive books help you do a deep dive. Among them are [Learning the bash Shell, 3rd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596009656.do), [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php), and [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/).

While we focused on using Bash interactively, Bash scripting is the most powerful built-in Linux sysadmin tool. Indeed, it's the ancestor to DevOps programs such as [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/), and [Puppet](https://puppet.com/).
