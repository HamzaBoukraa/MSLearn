# Use a hook to deploy to a website

You're finally ready to make your website available inside the company, and
you want to update it automatically whenever anyone pushes a change.  You need
a `post-update` hook.

* `git clone project website`
* install post-update hook to pull changes into the website when master is
  pushed.
* push a change

You can also use this technique to back up a software project on a file server
or even a thumb drive.
