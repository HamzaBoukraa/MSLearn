# Collaborate using a shared repo

Directly pulling from someone else's repository works, provided you're both on the same network, but it's a clumsy process â€” and most collaborators are not on the same network. It's much better to set up a central repository to which everyone involved can push as well as pull from.

When you tell [Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob) about your project, and he asks to participate too, that's exactly what you decide to do.

## Create a bare repository

What you need is a repository that doesn't have a working tree. That's called a _bare repository_. A bare repo has several advantages:

- Without a working tree, everybody can push changes without having to worry about which branch is checked out.
- It's easy for Git to detect when somebody else has pushed changes that might conflict with yours (because your push wouldn't be fast-forward, and Git's default is to reject it so that you can merge the new files with your own).
- A shared repo scales to any number of developers. You only have to know about the shared repo rather than about all the other people from whom you might need to pull.
- By putting the shared repo on a server that you can all access, you don't have to worry about firewalls and permissions.
- You don't need separate accounts on the server, because Git keeps track of who made each commit. GitHub has millions of users all sharing the `git` account. (Everyone uses `ssh`, and users are distinguished by their public keys.) 

Creating a bare repo for sharing is easy.

1. Create a new directory named "Shared.git" on your hard disk to hold the bare repo. Once more, the directory name is not important, but we will refer to it as the "Shared.git" directory or simply the *shared* directory in these exercises.

	> Naming the directory "Shared.git" follows the longstanding tradition of assigning bare repositories a name ending with `.git` to distinguish them from working trees. It is a convention but not a requirement.

	Assuming you are currently in the project directory, use these commands to created the shared directory as a sibling of the project directory and `cd` into it:

	```bash
	cd ..
	mkdir Shared.git
	cd Shared.git
	```

1. Now use the following command to create a bare repo in the shared directory:

	```bash
	git init --bare
	```

1. The next step is to get the contents of _your_ repo into the shared repo. Start by `cd`ing back to the project directory where your repo is stored. Then use these commands to set up an "origin" remote and perform an initial push:

	```
	git remote add origin ../Shared.git
	git push origin master
	```

1. You want `push` and `pull` to use "origin's" master branch by default, just as if you had made your repo by cloning it in the first place. To do so, you need to tell Git which branch to track:

	```
	git branch --set-upstream-to origin/master
	```

Git would have complained if you had tried to do this before the initial push, because the new repository had no branches yet. Git can't track a branch that doesn't exist. All Git is doing under the hood is looking in ".git/refs/remotes" for a file named **origin/trunk**.

## Set up for collaborators

The next step is for Bob to clone the bare repository, and then for Alice to set the origin in her repo to target the shared repo for pushes and pulls.

1. Create a directory named "Bob" that's a sibling of your project directory and `cd` into the "Bob" directory:

	```bash
	cd ..
	mkdir Bob
	cd Bob
	```

2. Now clone the shared repo, and be sure to include the period at the end of the command:

	```Bash
	git clone ../Shared.git/ .
	```

1. Currently, Alice's repo is configured to push to and pull from her own repo. Use the following commands to `cd` to the "Alice" directory and change "origin" to point to the shared repo:

	```bash
	cd ../Alice
	git remote set-url origin ../Shared.git
	git push
	```

The push wasn't necessary, but it's a simple way of making sure the remote is set up with the correct defaults.

## Learn the basics of collaboration

Now that Bob is set up to work on the Web site, he decides to add a footer ti the bottom of the page. Let's take on Bob and Alice's persona for a few moments and learn the basics of collaboration.

1. Begin by navigating to the "Bob" directory and impersonating Bob:

	```bash
	cd ../Bob
	git config user.name Bob
	git config user.email bob@contoso.com
	```

1. Use your favorite text editor to open **index.html** and replace the `<hr>` element near the bottom of the page with this:

	```html
	<footer><hr>Copyright (c) 2019 Contoso Cats</footer>
	```

	Then save the file.

1. Commit the changes and push to the remote origin:

	```
	git commit -a -m "Put a footer at the bottom of the page"
	git push
	```

1. While Bob is editing the site, Alice is, too. She decides to add a nav bar to the page. This will require her to modify two files: **index.html** and **site.css**. `cd` to the "Alice" directory and configure Git to use Alice's credentials:

	```bash
	cd ../Alice
	git config user.name Alice
	git config user.email alice@contoso.com
	```

1. Now 



He sends email to you and Alice to let you know that he's made a change.

Meanwhile, Alice decides to add a nav bar to the page, and adds a line to the style sheet for it as well.

```
$ cd ~/sandbox/Alice/Cats
$ sed -i.bak -e '/<body>/a<nav> <a href="./index.html">home<\/a> <\/nav>' index.html
$ echo 'nav { background-color: #C0D8DF; }' >> assets/site.css
```

Then Alice sees Bob's email, and decides to pull his changes before she commits her own. (If she had already committed her change, she would have a different problem, which we discuss in the next unit.) She types:

```
$ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

   37903fd..99fbbca  master     -> origin/master
Updating 37903fd..99fbbca
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
	index.html
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
Aborting
```

It looks as though Git prevented a problem. Only `index.html` would have been overwritten; Bob didn't make any changes in `site.css`. If Alice hadn't changed `index.html`, Git would have gone ahead and committed the merge. If it did so, it could have caused trouble later on. (This is one reason why it's always a good idea to run tests after a merge.)

Alice uses `git diff` to see what Bob's changes were, specifying both the branch (`origin`) and the file (`index.html) to compare.


```
$  git diff origin -- index.html
diff --git a/index.html b/index.html
index 8ff78df..b8732b6 100644
--- a/index.html
+++ b/index.html
@@ -6,8 +6,9 @@
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/site.css">

 <h1>Our Furry Friends</h1>
 <p> Eventually we will put cat pictures here.
-<footer><hr></footer>
+<hr>
 </body>
 </html>
```

Alice can see that, although she and Bob both changed the same file, their changes don't overlap. She decides to _stash_ her changes. `git stash` saves the state of the working tree and index by making a couple of temporary commits. Think of the stash as a way to save your current work while you do something else, without making a "real" commit or affecting your repository history.

In reality, Alice should have stashed or committed her changes before she
tried to pull. Pulling to a "dirty" working tree is risky, because it can do things from which you can't recover.

```
$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: 37903fd change background color to light blue
```

Now it's safe for Alice to pull, after which she can "pop" the stash, which is organized as a stack. (In fact, `git stash` is shorthand for `git stash push`.  It's a lot like the stack where you put bills that you haven't gotten around to paying yet.) 

```
$ git pull
Updating 37903fd..99fbbca
Fast-forward
 index.html | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
$ git stash pop
Auto-merging index.html
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   assets/site.css
	modified:   index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
Dropped refs/stash@{0} (cad3c4cd27de5ca9b0a6e88b379fa8fda43246f5)
```

Popping the stash merges the changes. If changes overlap, there may be a conflict. We look later at how to resolve those situations.

At this point Alice can continue working, or simply commit and push her changes.

She gives footers the same style as nav bars.

```
$ sed -i.bak -e 's/nav/nav, footer/' assets/site.css
$ git commit -a -m 'add nav bar to page'
[master 88bed5a] add nav bar to page
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
$ git push

```

If Alice had committed her changes rather than stashing them, the situation
would have been somewhat different. She would have had to make a branch and
either merge or rebase her changes.  (Branches, merging, and rebasing are
covered in the next unit.)

Had Alice begun by working on a branch in the first place she would have saved herself quite a lot of trouble. We'll see
how to do that in the next unit; for now it's worth pointing out that branching and rebasing is _exactly_ what the stash commands accomplish behind the scenes.

## Summary

In this unit, you learned how to set up a bare repository that can be shared among a group of developers, and about the Git commands

* [`git commit --bare`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit), which sets up a repo that can be shared
* [`git push`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push), which merges changes with a remote repo, and
* [`git stash`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash), which saves un-committed changes so that you can merge safely.

In the next unit, you learn how to create and merge branches.
