# Inside the git repository

Let's peek under the hood for a moment and look at the repo to see what `git`
has done so far.  This is also a good opportunity to learn some more of
`git`'s terminology.

* blob, commit, tree-ish, ref,...  We can use `git cat-file` and `git show` to
  investigate objects.
* master branch, HEAD, refs
* briefly mention hooks, branches, logs
