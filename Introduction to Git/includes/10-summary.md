# Summary

In this module, you learned the basics of using Git. You learned how to install Git, how to create and clone repositories, how to track changes, how to collaborate with other team members using a shared repository, how to use branches to isolate your changes, how to merge branches, and more. You even learned one technique for recovering from merge conflicts â€” something that sooner or later, you will have to do.

At this point, you know enough about Git to perform everyday tasks, get yourself out of trouble if something goes awry, and understand the documentation. If you would like to dig deeper, here are some resources that you'll find helpful:

- On the command line, `git help tutorial` and `git help tutorial-2`
- [Everyday Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/everyday) (also available from the command line, as `git help everyday`)
- [Learn Enough Git to Be  Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial/getting_started)
- GitHub's [Git and GitHub learning resources](https://help.github.com/en/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources)
- [A Hacker's Guide to Git](https://wildlyinaccurate.com/a-hackers-guide-to-git/)

You can also learn more from the [documentation section](https://git-scm.com/doc) of [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com).
